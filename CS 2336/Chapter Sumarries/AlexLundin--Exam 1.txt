	Pre and post increment with expressions
	
	What is the value of x at each point?
	
	int x = 0;
	x = (x++) + 1;		
						//	what is x now?
	
	++x;				//	what is x now?
						// 	what is x now?

2
	Integer division, what does result equal at each point?
	
	int x = 5;
	double y = 1.0;
	int z = 1;
	
	double result = 0.0;
	
	result = x / z;					// here
	result = x / y;					// here
	result = (double)x / z;			// here
	
3
	Dangling else
	
	Which if will the else pair with?
	
	if 		(x % 2 == 0)
			((System.out.println("x is even"));

			if	(x % 5 == 0)
					(System.out.println ("x is divisible by 5");
			
			else	
			System.out.println.println ("x is odd");

4
	What is the range of the char type in Unicode format?
	
5
	How many spaces are added before the decimal integer printed below?
	
	int = 5;
	Widthfactor = 20;
	
	System.out.printf("Decimal integer %5d", integer);
	
6
	Where does the loop body start and end?
	
	int i = 1;
	while (i < 10)
		if(i % 2 == 0)
			System.out.println(i);
			i++;

	Match each property to the following items:
	Instance Variable
	Instance Method
	Static Variable
	Static Method
	
	-	requires an object to make the call
	-	data that is specific to one object
	- 	data that is shared by all objects of a classes
	-	only requires the class name to make the call
