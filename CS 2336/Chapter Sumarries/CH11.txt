Chapter 11 Book
	11.1
		Obj
		
		Content	
	11.2
		Obj
		Define subclass from superclass
		Inheritance
		
		Content
		cp	- a subclass is not ALWAYS a subset of a superclass, in some cases subclasses contain more data than super
		cp	- extends is the keyword to define a subclass extended from a super
		cp	- single inheritance is only one parent, multiple is not supported by java
	11.3
		Obj
		Invoker superclass constructor with super()
		
		Content
		super keyword is used to invoke super class methods and access data from super
		must always call superclass constructor in the subclass as the FIRST statement
		understand that using this keyword with no args calls default constructor
		this keyword followed by args, this(args), calls value constructor
		
		cp	- java does not includ default constructor when value constructor is programmed in
		cp	- super keyword invokes super methods and data access
		cp	- false, value constructors can be accessed with super keyword as well as default
		
	11.4
		Obj
		Override instance methods in subclass
		
		Content
		override	- same signature and return type in sub as in super
					- instance overide, only if accessible
					- static cannot override, hidden when redefined in sub
					  called with SuperClassName.staticMethodName
	
		cp	- cannot override private method
		cp	- cannot override static method, redefining in subclass hides the super
		cp	- explicit super constructor, super(arg list);
		cp	- super.method() to invoke a method from super
	11.5
		Obj
		Override vs overload
		
		Content
	11.6
		Obj
		toString() method in object class
		
		Content
	11.7
		Obj
		Polymorphism
		Dynamic binding
		
		Content
	11.8
		Obj
		Polymorphism
		Dynamic binding
		

		Content
		Explain polymorphism
				When a method using a type of the superclass, accepts a subclass object as well
				using a object of subclass when a object of superclass is used
				
				
		Explain dynamic binding
				When a method accepts a object as a arugment
				It determines the steps of execution at runtime depending on which level of object is sent increment
				Start at most specific and work upwards until most generic case is found
				Then the implemenataion path is complete
				First found inmplementation is used
				
		Method matching
			Has to due with signatures and overloading
			Determined by DECLARED type of object
			
		Method binding
			Happens at run time
			Has to due with inheritance, polymorphism and overriding
			Determined by ACTUAL type of object used in the method call
