Objectives
To explore the relationship between interfaces and classes in the Java Collections Framework hierarchy (§20.2).
To use the common methods defined in the Collection interface for operating collections (§20.2).
To use the Iterator interface to traverse the elements in a collection (§20.3).
To use a for-each loop to traverse the elements in a collection (§20.3).
To explore how and when to use ArrayList or LinkedList to store elements (§20.4).
To compare elements using the Comparable interface and the Comparator interface (§20.5).
To use the static utility methods in the Collections class for sorting, searching, shuffling lists, and finding the largest and smallest element in collections (§20.6).
To develop a multiple bouncing balls application using ArrayList (§20.7).
To distinguish between Vector and ArrayList and to use the Stack class for creating stacks (§20.8).
To explore the relationships among Collection, Queue, LinkedList, and PriorityQueue and to create priority queues using the PriorityQueue class (§20.9).
To use stacks to write a program to evaluate expressions (§20.10).

	Collection  - holds group of objects
				- lists, sets maps

	List	- sequential order
			- user specify element order
			- acess by index
	List iterator
			- add
			- has previous
			- has next
			- previous
			- previous Index
			-set
	ArrayList
			-radomn acess through index
			-insert, remove from end only
			
	LinkedList
			-insert, remove from anywhere
			-grow shrink dynamically
			
	Array
			- no insert or delete
			- fixed size
			
	Vector Class
			- same as ArrayList
			- additions for accessing and modifying a vector
			
	Stack	
			-LIFO
			-access from top
			-retrive, insert and remove from top
	
	Queue
			-FIFO
			-elements added to end
			-retrieved from beginning
