Summary

PowerPoint
	Terms
	Node, vertex
	Edges connect nodes, vertex
	Root is source nodes
	Leaves have no children
	
	Height , max number of edges from root to leaf
	Depth, number of edges to nodes
	Binary Tree
		Each node has max of 2 children
		
	Traversal	
		Pre-order
			Root, left, right
		In-order
			left, root, root
		Post-order
			left, right, root
			
	Binary Search Tree	
		Each node has max 2 children
		Order
			Left subtree less than node
			Right subtree greater than node
		Terms
			Successor
				Min node from right subtree
			Predecessor
				Max node from left subtree
		Find
		Worst Case time complexity
			O(n)
				lopsided tree, essentially a list
				
		Insert
		Worst Case time complexity
			O(n)
				lopsided tree, essentially a list
				
		Build
		Worst Case Time
			O(n2)
				lopsided starting list of data
		Best Case
			O(nlogn)
				balanced starting list of data
