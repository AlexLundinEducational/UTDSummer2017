To design classes that follow the class-design guidelines (§13.10).

	public abstract class GraphicObject {
	   // declare fields
	   // declare nonabstract methods
	   abstract void draw();
	}
	
	Abstract Classes:
	Abstract Methods and Classes
	in a nonabstract subclass extended from an abstract class, all the abstract methods must be implemented, 
	even if they are not used in the subclass. 
	
	Cannot be instantiated with NEW
	Can be used as data type though, like an Array
	GeometricObject[] geo = new GeometricObject[10];
	
	Rather, created by the non abstract child
	
	Overload - same name, diff args
	Override - inheritance
	
	Interfaces:
	
	public interface InterfaceName { 
	  constant declarations;
	  abstract method signatures;
	}
	
	data - public final static
	methods - public abstract
	
	Interface v Abstract	
	
		Interface
		Data constants
		Method signatures only
		Abstact
		All kinds of data
		Methods can be concerete or abstract
