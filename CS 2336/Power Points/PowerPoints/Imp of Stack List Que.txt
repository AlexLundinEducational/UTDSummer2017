Objectives
To design common features of lists in an interface and provide skeleton implementation in an abstract class (§24.2).
To design and implement a dynamic list using an array (§24.3).
To design and implement a dynamic list using a linked structure (§24.4).
To design and implement a stack class using an array list and a queue class using a linked list (§24.5).
To design and implement a priority queue using a heap (§24.6).

	List
		Functionality
		Retrieve element from anywhere
		Insert new
		Delete element
		Length
		Search
		Empty or not
	
	Implemenations
		Array
			Fixed size
		LinkedList
			Ability to extend size
			
	Need to understand the tradoffs in time complexity
